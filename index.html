		<h1>Updating Web Pages With AJAX</h1>
		<!-- Fist paragraph -->
		<p><a id="2">Ajax is a technique that allows web pages displayed on a client computer to quickly interact and exchange data with a web server without reloading the entire page.  
					 Ajax relies on JavaScript and a data interchange format, such as JSON or XML.  The XMLHttpRequest object –commonly referred to as the XHR object – uses HTTP to 
					 exchange data between a client computer and a web server.  Unlike standard HTTP requests, the XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request and receive data without 
					 reloading a web page.</a></p>
		
		<!-- Sketch of overall process  -->

		<!-- Second paragraph-->
		<p><a id="2">Google was one of the first commercial websites to implement an Ajax application – its Google suggest search functionality.  As the user begins typing in their 
					 search box, search suggestions like those shown below begin to appear.  The important thing to remember is that as the user types each letter, JavaScript code 
					 uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send the string to the Google Server, which attempts to match the typed characters with a list of suggestions.  The Google 
					 sever then returns the list of suggestions to the client computer (without refreshing the webpage) and JavaScript code populated the suggestion list with the 
					 response text.</a></p>
		
		<!-- Picture of Google showing predictive text-->
		<img src="Images/GoogleSearch.jpg" class="left">
		<p></p>
		<p><a id="2">One way information can be exchanged is through a Web Service.  This is where a data source is sxposed by one domain for use on other domains.  These Web 
			         Services are simply a service in which data is sent in response to a request using the methods and properties of their API’s (Application Program 
					 Interface).</a></p>
		<p></p>
		<p><a id="2">Some examples of Web Services would include real-time pricing on commodities or stocks, current weather and the like.  On the Demonstration link 
				    of this tutorial a link connection is made to the NASA, Picture of the Day, Web Service and pulls back data which includes an image.  One item of 
					note is most web services require an API key in order to limit the number of calls in a time period.  Additionally, many Web Services offer 
					instructions for connecting as well as parameters and method call lists.  You can go to NASA’s API site here:  https://api.nasa.gov/</a></p>
